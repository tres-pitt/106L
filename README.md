This is an old QT project I did for a class, implementing a certain graph visualization algorithm.
The idea is that nodes repel and attract each other, and an equilibrium is eventually reached.
You enter how much time you want to spend watching the nodes move around, picking an initial graph from the res folder.
Unfortunately, you have to re-compile and re-run to do this more than once.

I edited the src directory, only.
